* Strict Mode and Prototype Propertyies
** Prototype Properties are not allowed to be overwritten

** #1: o must contain the properties.
** #2: encapsulate the prototype?

* pre and post state comparing works only if return the value in a function.
** because bound value are only as create time



;;;;; remarks Feb. 26. 2014

* With in a SandboxContract is without any functionality

* Identity preserving Membrabne inside of the sandbox
** Opaque Poxies in the outside world




;;;;; remarks Feb. 6. 2014

* communication channel
** you are either allowed to read x or y, but neither both
** so, you are interested in storing something
** less restrictions as possible, so, you should be allowd to write values?

* not contract is interested for sanitizer 

* erase functions (independent from sandbox)
  ** required for with, dependent contract




  ;;;;; remarks Feb. 5. 2014

  * Function.prototype can be overwritten
  ** so, current isNativeFunction is not safe.

  * Problem: is nativePassThrough is disabled
  ** only simple contracts can be used, because construct and apply are native funcios

  * Function, number of arguments can be checked with contract
