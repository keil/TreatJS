#2 Blame in Contracts
- restrict throw is not a possibe because the CB structure is already updated

#3 Indy/ 3CH Blaming
- contract assertions has to strore
  map: <target> --> <contract>

- sandbox exnapsulation has to check 
-- id the original <target> is contracted (map.has(<target>))
-- if yes, that the contract has to be assigend to the decompiled function
   decompile(<target>) @ map(<target>)
-- and an special callback has to be set
--- outside context is always true; 
--- inside context is mapped to outside contract;
--- inside subject is the outside subject
